            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Exploring emotional distance through cinematic realism</p>
        </div>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Creative Vision</h3>
            <p>"Between Us, the Tide" is a photorealistic fantasy narrative exploring themes of longing, connection,
                and ethereal romance. Set on a surreal neon-lit beach at night, the project tells the story of a young
                man's encounter with an angelic presence—a metaphor for dreams, memories, or desires just beyond reach.
                The 122 BPM rhythm pulses through every scene, creating a hypnotic atmosphere where reality blurs with
                fantasy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Prompt Strategy: Melancholic Realism</h3>
            <p>The project employed a "Melancholic Realism" approach, carefully balancing photorealistic rendering with
                dreamlike fantasy elements. Key emotional keywords such as "serious and distant," "withdrawn," and
                "contemplative" were strategically embedded in prompts to dictate nuanced body language and facial
                expressions. This technique ensured that characters conveyed complex internal states without relying on
                dialogue or overt gestures.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Critical Innovation:</strong> The use of "shallow depth of field" as a visual metaphor for
                    emotional distance proved essential. By keeping one character sharp while the other softly blurs,
                    the imagery reinforces the psychological separation between the subjects—they share the same space
                    but exist in different emotional realities.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Lighting Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The neon lighting scheme—pink, purple, and magenta—serves both aesthetic and narrative functions. The
                soft pink neon rim light from the ocean symbolizes hope and attraction, while the purple-magenta ambient
                fill from the sky represents melancholy and introspection. This duality creates visual tension that
                mirrors the emotional complexity of the narrative, where beauty and sadness coexist in every frame.</p>

                    <p>Her ethereal transparency increases progressively until only a faint pink glow remains, then
                        nothing. The neon waves continue unchanged, indifferent to her departure.</p>

                    <strong>Emotional Resolution</strong>
                    <p>The ending is bittersweet rather than tragic. The man's gradual forgetting suggests acceptance—
                        perhaps this happens repeatedly, a recurring dream or memory he visits and releases. The
                        ethereal fade-out leaves viewers questioning whether she was ever truly there.</p>

                    <strong>Final Note</strong>
                    <p>The scene ends with the man alone on the beach once more, the neon waves continuing their
                        eternal rhythm. The circular structure suggests the narrative could begin again—longing,
                        connection, loss, and acceptance in an endless cycle.</p>

            <h3>Key Technical Achievements</h3>
            <p>Successfully balanced photorealistic rendering with fantasy elements by establishing clear rules: the
                man remains entirely grounded in physical reality while the woman exists in an ambiguous space between
                solid and ethereal. This duality was achieved through careful attention to lighting physics—her
                translucency still obeys real-world light behavior, making her feel tangible despite being obviously
                otherworldly.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The shallow depth of field technique proved essential not just as a visual
                style choice but as a narrative device. By selectively focusing on one character while softly blurring
                the other, each shot reinforces the theme of emotional separation. This approach elevated simple
                two-character compositions into nuanced visual metaphors.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Prompt Engineering Insights</h3>
            <p>The "Melancholic Realism" strategy required extensive experimentation with emotional keywords. Terms like
                "serious and distant," "withdrawn," and "contemplative" were more effective than explicitly describing
                facial expressions or body positions. Allowing the AI to interpret emotional states rather than physical
                configurations resulted in more natural, nuanced performances.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Rhythm synchronization at 122 BPM demanded precise timing specifications in
                every prompt. Rather than describing movements as "slow" or "fast," defining exact beat counts (e.g.,
                "one step every 2 beats," "sway side to side every 4 beats") ensured consistency across all 16 scenes
                and made the final editing process seamless.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Narrative Philosophy</h3>
            <p>"Between Us, the Tide" intentionally embraces ambiguity. Is the woman a ghost? A dream? A memory? An
                idealized projection? The narrative refuses to answer definitively, allowing each viewer to interpret
                the story through their own experiences of longing, loss, and connection. This ambiguity was maintained
                through careful balance—making her tangible enough to feel present while ethereal enough to question her
                reality.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The circular structure (ending where it began, with the man alone on the
                beach) suggests the emotional patterns we repeat—reaching for what we cannot hold, finding brief
                connection, experiencing loss, and beginning again. The neon waves, constant throughout, represent the
                passage of time indifferent to human drama.</p>

            <p><strong>Final Reflection:</strong> This project demonstrated that AI video generation has matured beyond
                technical showcase into genuine emotional storytelling. By prioritizing atmosphere, character nuance,
                and visual metaphor over spectacle, "Between Us, the Tide" proves that AI-generated narratives can
                engage viewers on a deeply emotional level—not despite the technology, but because of how thoughtfully
                it's applied.</p>
